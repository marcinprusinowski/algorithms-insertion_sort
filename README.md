# Insertion Sort!

Insertion sort is simple sorting algorithm which works the same way as you sort paying card games in your hand. The array is virtually split to sorted and unsorted arrays. The first loop is pointing at the first element of unsorted array and the nested loop is picking next element and put it in correct place in sorted array.
Here is a quick and great visualisation of Insertion Sort

# Conclusion
Insertion sort is in place sorting algorithm.
It's time complexity in average and worst case is O(n*n), but in case where array is already sorted it is O(n). During each iteration, the first remaining element of the input is only compared with the right-most element of the sorted subsection of the array. That gives as linear time complexity.
Feel free to download the code and try, but I suggest you to implement it by yourself first.
